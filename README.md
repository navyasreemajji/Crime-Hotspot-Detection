# Crime-Hotspot-Detection
Crime Hotspot Detection & Visualization is a project designed to identify high-crime zones and analyze crime patterns over time. It uses clustering techniques to detect hotspots based on geolocation data, and machine learning models to predict the category of crimes using features like location, weekday, month, and weekend status. The project also includes trend analysis to understand how crimes vary across time and space. Interactive visualizations such as heatmaps and plots were created to clearly present the findings. This system can assist law enforcement or urban planners in resource allocation and public safety strategies.
